### Cooperative

**Strengths**
Steph - Learning
Chris - JavaScript

1. **Utilizing Strengths in Application Development**:
   - **Chris's JavaScript Expertise**: Assign tasks related to front-end development, interactive features, or anything heavily reliant on JavaScript to Chris. His proficiency will ensure robust coding in these areas.
   - **Stephanie's Learning Ability**: Utilize Stephanie's ability to learn quickly in various ways. She could assist in research, explore new libraries or frameworks, or even adapt to different coding languages as needed. Her adaptability can be valuable in troubleshooting and exploring new avenues within the project.
2. **Areas of Development**:
   - **Chris**: While proficient in JavaScript, Chris might want to deepen his knowledge in advanced JavaScript concepts, frameworks like React or Angular, or explore back-end development to become a more versatile developer.
   - **Stephanie**: She might aim to enhance her coding skills by focusing on JavaScript, understanding its nuances, and possibly branching out into related areas such as CSS or HTML to broaden her technical expertise.
3. **Approach to Day-to-Day Development**:
   - **Collaborative Learning**: Schedule regular code review sessions where both Chris and Stephanie can discuss their work. This fosters a learning environment, ensuring both understand the codebase and learn from each other.
   - **Pair Programming**: Encourage Chris and Stephanie to work together on certain tasks. Pair programming allows knowledge sharing, problem-solving, and mutual learning, ensuring both are involved in the code's understanding and creation.
   - **Task Allocation**: Distribute tasks in a way that both individuals have exposure to different aspects of the application. This ensures that while Chris may lead certain sections requiring JavaScript expertise, Stephanie is involved enough to understand and learn from the process.
By combining Chris's expertise and Stephanie's learning agility, the team can create a well-rounded development approach where both members contribute significantly while continually learning and improving their skill sets.

### Conflict Resolution

1. **Unequal Contribution**:
   - **Assessment:** The team needs an honest discussion about workload distribution. Understanding why one person is doing most of the work is crucial. Is it due to skill gaps, lack of motivation, or something else?
   - **Communication:** Open dialogue is key. Express concerns respectfully and allow the less-contributing member to voice their thoughts. This can reveal underlying issues or barriers.
   - **Reassignment of Tasks:** Redistribute tasks based on strengths and interests. Providing clear roles and responsibilities can encourage equal contribution.
2. **Dominating Team Member**:
   - **Team Meeting:** A team discussion is necessary to address this issue. Highlight the importance of collaboration and the detrimental effects of one person taking over.
   - **Encourage Participation:** Ensure that everyone has an opportunity to contribute. Facilitate brainstorming sessions or assign specific sections of the project to different team members.
   - **Feedback and Encouragement:** Give positive feedback when someone steps back to allow others to contribute. It reinforces the value of collaboration.
3. **Skill and Understanding Differences**:
   - **Acknowledge Differences:** Recognize that each team member brings unique skills and experiences to the table. Embrace diversity in skills and knowledge.
   - **Learning Environment:** Create an environment where learning and skill development are encouraged. Pairing team members with varying skill levels for tasks can facilitate knowledge sharing.
   - **Support and Guidance:** Offer support and guidance to bridge skill gaps. Encourage the sharing of knowledge and resources among team members.
